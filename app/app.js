  <h1>Formula 1: 2022 Season</h1>

    <h2>What is Formula 1? (F1)</h2>
    <p>
      Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class
      of international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula
      racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de
      l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which
      became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been
      one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its
      inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to
      the set of rules to which all participants' cars must
      conform.[1] A Formula One season consists of a series of races,
      known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both
      purpose-built circuits and closed public roads. (Wikipedia)

    <h2>Why am I into F1?</h2>
    <p>
      There are many genres of games out there in the world. Strangely
      enough, instead of getting into most feminine games like Sims or
      Stardew Valley, I found myself into the trenches of racing
      games. With games such as Redout, Inertial Drift, Tackmania, and
      even a racing minigame inside of the MMO Guild Wars 2, I've
      found myself in love with the "zooms." It was only natural that
      I then found myself getting into racing. Given that I live in
      Indianapolis, it puts me very close to the Speedway race track,
      known for the Indy 500 race. F1 is a much more complex sport
      than the Indy 500, but being so close was an introduction to
      what has quickly grown into an addiction to speed.

<h3>Daniel Ricciardo & Lando Norris</h3>

    <h5>Name : Lando Norris</h5>

    <h5>Home Town : Glastonbury, UK</h5>
    <p>
      Lando Norris is one of the younger drivers in F1 currently,
      being born in 1999. Despite being so young, he's quite a
      phenomenal driver, having 5 podium finishes already within his
      career. He has been known for his determination so far in the F1
      circuit, and has developed quite a commraderie with several of
      the other drivers. A true testament to the sport, the youngster
      is certainly one to follow. As my personal favorite driver for this season, we'll certainly have to see where the future takes them.

    <p>
      Daniel Riccardio is an older face to the F1 sport when compared to his team mate. He has found himself shared between many of the F1 teams during his career as well. His contageous attitude and bright smile make him a very appealing racer to watch. With 8 wins and 24 other podium finishes, he's seen his share of the good, the bad, and the ugly. As a favorite of a close friend of mine, it's rather fun to root for two drivers on the same team.

              <p>
                Lewis Hamilton is hands down one of the more accomplished drivers within F1. Known for his current 7 world-title wins within F1, he has had quite the career. With 103 total race wins, 182 podium finishes, and many other accalades to his name, Hamilton continues to be a fan-favorite around the world. I certainly agree, as Lewis Hamilton was one of the first racers that I became a fan of. His personality in press interviews is rather engaging, and he is always a fun driver to watch.

              <p>
                George Russell is also a newer face to F1, starting his career in the same year of Lando Norris, 2019. He has yet to have any wins under his belt, only placing on the podium once so far during his career. He is new to the Mercedes F1 team for the 2022 season, having previously raced under the Williams team. It is yet to be known how Russell will be doing in this year's grand prix, but given that he has Lewis Hamilton as a teammate, it is bound to be an interesting season for where he will go.

    <h5>Name : Lance Stroll</h5>

    <h5>Home Town : Montreal, CAN</h5>
    <p>
      Lance Stroll is another youngster to F1. Beginning his career in 2017, he still has managed 3 podiums. There is quite a bit to look forward to from young Stroll. Admittedly, I'm following the Aston Martin team much more for the appearance of their cars than their drivers, so we will see how the two end up faring. So far this season, they've had a bit of a rough time in the 2022 races. Could there be a surprise upset from Stroll and his teammate?

    <p>
      Nico Hulkenburg is the reserve F1 driver for the Aston Martin team. As such, he has no official page on their website, and is substituting in this season for Sebastian Vettel. It will be an interesting season, as the racer has previously raced under several teams such as Williams, Renault, and Racing Point. He has not had any known podium finishes, but has had an overall stable career.
