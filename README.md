This particular assignment focuses on dynamic content. It introduces jQuery as the method for allowing for a single page to load in multiple other "pages" dynamically, without actually ever leaving to a different page. I chose to focus on a particular topic I've come to enjoy, being F1. I tried my best to use mixins, variables, and other learned content throughout the semester within this project. I found it rather easy to end up developing for this dynamic page, and really, the only question I had to ask my self was whether or not I wanted to make several pages and combine them into one or not. Ultimately, I chose not to, and we have the page I have created today!
